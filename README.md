# VisionLibrary
My Vision library for AOI. It is based on OpenCV and Boost. It Provide learning, inspection, alignment and record management utilities.
This project is developed based on OpenCV, also need opencv_contrib xfeature2d.
Before build the project, need to build the OpenCV, and set the include path and library path to the VisionLibrary project.
The boost library is using 1.59.0, i didn't upload to git because it is too big, to build need to download boost and put the .\ExtLibs\boost_1_59_0.
